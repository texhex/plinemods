## Installation

* Use the *Clone or download button* to download this [repository as ZIP](https://github.com/texhex/plinemods/archive/master.zip)
* Open the local path ``C:\Users\[your username]\Documents\My Games\`` e.g. ``C:\Users\John\Documents\My Games\``
* Create a new folder ``productionline`` (if it does no already exist), then change to this created folder, and create a new folder called ``mods``
* The entire path should now be ``C:\Users\John\Documents\My Games\productionline\mods``
* Copy any *MakeXXX* folder from the ZIP archive into this ``mods`` folder
* For example, if you want to use [MakeHeater](https://github.com/texhex/plinemods/tree/master/MakeHeater), just copy the folder ``MakeHeater`` into the ``mods`` folder
* The entire path for this mod would therefore be ``C:\Users\John\Documents\My Games\productionline\mods\MakeHeater``
* Please note: Copy the entire folder from the ZIP directly to the ``mods``, including any subfolders.
* To check if it worked, click the *Mods* entry within the main menu
